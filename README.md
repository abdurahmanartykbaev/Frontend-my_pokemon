# Welcome to My Pokemon App

# Task
The task at hand was to create a multiple-page app, with the ability to display all Pokemon, lazy loading for better performance, and detailed pages for individual Pokemon. Additionally, the application needed to include a search bar to filter Pokemon and utilize Axios for API requests.

# Description
My Pokemon App is designed to provide users with an immersive experience into the world of Pokemon. The application consists of two main pages:

All Pokemon Page: This page displays a list of all available Pokemon, with lazy loading implemented to enhance performance by only loading Pokemon data as the user scrolls. Users can easily scroll through the list to discover various Pokemon species.

Pokemon Detail Page: Upon selecting a specific Pokemon from the list, users are directed to a detailed page that provides comprehensive information about the selected Pokemon, including its abilities and stats. A search bar is also available on this page to facilitate easy filtering of Pokemon.

# Installation
To install and run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run npm install to install the dependencies.
Start the development server by running npm start.
Access the application in your web browser.

# Usage
Once the application is running, you can navigate between pages to explore different Pokemon. Use the search bar to filter Pokemon by name and find specific entries quickly. Enjoy browsing through the vast collection of Pokemon and learning more about your favorites!
